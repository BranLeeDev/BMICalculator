              <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>
              <p>
                A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a healthy
                weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, such as
                obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar
                content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular
                physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.

                  <h3>Healthy eating</h3>
                  <p>
                    Healthy eating promotes weight control, disease prevention, better digestion,
                    immunity, mental clarity, and mood.

                  <p>
                    Exercise improves fitness, aids weight control, elevates mood, and reduces
                    disease risk, fostering wellness and longevity.

          <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>
          <p>
            Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for
            every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in
            certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.

            <p>
              The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age.
              Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.

            <p>
              In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to
              underestimate body fat content.

              BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't
              differentiate muscle from fat.

              Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a

              child.

              Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at
              lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this with your GP or
              practice nurse.
